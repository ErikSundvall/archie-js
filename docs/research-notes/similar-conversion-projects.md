**Technology**: Clean rewrite in JavaScript
**Scale**: Medium (utility library)
**Outcome**:
- ✅ Better performance than original
- ✅ More maintainable
- ✅ Added features during rewrite
- ✅ Smaller bundle size (modular)

**Lessons for Archie**:
- Clean rewrites can improve on original
- Opportunity to modernize architecture
- Modular design from start
- Fresh start removes technical debt

### RxJS (from Reactive Extensions .NET)
**Project**: Reactive programming library
**Technology**: Concept port to TypeScript
**Scale**: Medium (complex reactive logic)
**Outcome**:
- ✅ Successful ecosystem
- ✅ Better performance than .NET equivalent
- ✅ Idiomatic JavaScript/TypeScript
- ✅ Wide adoption

**Lessons for Archie**:
- Conceptual ports can excel
- Language-specific idioms important
- Understanding over line-by-line translation
- Tests critical for equivalence validation

## 5. Failed/Abandoned Approaches

### GWT (Google Web Toolkit)
**Project**: Java→JavaScript framework
**Technology**: Java transpilation
**Scale**: Large (framework)
**Status**: ⚠️ Maintenance mode, low adoption
**Why**:
- Complex tooling
- Slower development cycle than native JS
- Lost to modern frameworks (React, Angular, Vue)
- Better alternatives emerged (TypeScript)

**Lessons for Archie**:
- Automated Java→JS not always best long-term
- Developer experience matters
- Modern tooling expectations
- Consider future maintenance burden

### Various WASM-first Projects (2015-2020)
**Projects**: Early WASM adopters
**Technology**: Early WASM compilers
**Status**: Many abandoned or switched approaches
**Why**:
- WASM tooling immature early on
- Debugging difficulties
- Bundle size issues
- JavaScript often sufficient

**Lessons for Archie**:
- WASM still maturing for complex applications
- Consider if complexity justified
- JavaScript/TypeScript may be simpler
- Wait for tooling maturity

## Comparative Timeline Analysis

### Automated Conversion (TeaVM/JSweet):
- **Initial conversion**: 1-3 months
- **Refinement**: 3-6 months
- **Total**: 6-9 months
- **Risk**: Medium (tooling limitations)

### Clean Rewrite (TypeScript):
- **Planning & Design**: 1-2 months
- **Core Implementation**: 4-6 months
- **Testing & Refinement**: 3-4 months
- **Total**: 9-12 months
- **Risk**: Medium (scope creep, feature parity)

### Hybrid Approach (Tool-assisted + manual):
- **Automated base**: 2-3 months
- **Manual refinement**: 4-6 months
- **Testing**: 2-3 months
- **Total**: 8-12 months
- **Risk**: Medium-High (coordination complexity)

## Recommendations Based on Case Studies

### For Archie Specifically:

**1. WASM Approach**:
- ⚠️ Wait for GraalVM maturity
- Consider TeaVM for proven path
- Expect longer debugging cycles
- Bundle size will be large

**2. Kotlin/JS Approach**:
- ❌ Not recommended unless Kotlin adoption planned for JVM too
- High conversion effort
- Ongoing dual maintenance

**3. TypeScript Rewrite**:
- ✅ Most similar to successful case studies
- Proven in healthcare (FHIR)
- Established parser tools (ANTLR)
- Best long-term maintainability
- Clear development experience

### Success Factors from Case Studies:
1. **Modular architecture** from start
2. **Comprehensive testing** during conversion
3. **Incremental delivery** (not big bang)
4. **Developer experience** prioritized
5. **Documentation** throughout process
6. **Community feedback** early and often
