**Upstream Branch:** upstream/adl_2.4_support (openEHR/archie)

## Branch Comparison Summary

### Current Status
The `javascript-experiments` branch (which this PR branch is based on) has **diverged** from the upstream `adl_2.4_support` branch. The javascript-experiments branch contains additional commits not present in upstream.

- d86be8bb - Bump org.apache.commons:commons-lang3 from 3.18.0 to 3.19.0 (#722)
- ...and many more project-specific commits

### Analysis

The javascript-experiments branch:
1. **Contains project-specific additions** - Task management files, PRDs, AI guidance documents
2. **Has merged some upstream master commits** - Through PR #5 and others
3. **Is ahead of upstream/adl_2.4_support** - With project-specific work

The branch appears to be a **fork for the JavaScript conversion project**, not meant to track upstream/adl_2.4_support exactly. It has intentionally diverged to add project management and conversion-specific files.

### Upstream Remote Configuration

- **Upstream remote added:** ✅ https://github.com/openEHR/archie.git
- **Upstream adl_2.4_support fetched:** ✅ 262de905

## Recommendations

1. **No rebase needed** - The divergence is intentional and contains project-specific work
2. **Monitor upstream** - Periodically check for important updates in upstream/adl_2.4_support
3. **Selective merging** - If needed, cherry-pick specific upstream commits rather than rebasing
4. **Current state acceptable** - The branch serves its purpose for the JavaScript conversion project

## Conclusion

Branch verification complete. The javascript-experiments branch is properly set up as a project fork with intentional divergence from upstream. No immediate action required.
