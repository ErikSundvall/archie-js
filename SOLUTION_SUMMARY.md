# Solution Summary: Moving PR to javascript-experiments Branch

## Problem
The PR #7 (from branch `copilot/update-prd-with-clarifications`) was accidentally merged to `main` instead of the intended `javascript-experiments` branch. The changes were then reverted from `main` via PR #8.

## Solution
The reverted changes have been successfully restored to the `javascript-experiments` branch through this PR.

## Steps Taken

1. **Identified the problem**: 
   - PR #7 merged commits from `copilot/update-prd-with-clarifications` to `main`
   - PR #8 reverted those changes from `main`
   - The original PR branch still exists remotely

2. **Retrieved the changes**:
   - Fetched the original PR branch `copilot/update-prd-with-clarifications`
   - Merged it into the local `javascript-experiments` branch

3. **Applied to working branch**:
   - Merged the updated `javascript-experiments` branch into this PR branch
   - This PR now contains all the changes that should go to `javascript-experiments`

## Files Restored

The following files from the reverted PR are now included:

### Documentation
- `docs/branch-verification.md`
- `docs/deepwiki-access.md`
- `docs/documentation-inventory.md`
- `docs/setup-verification-report.md`
- `docs/test-results.md`

### AI Guidance
- `AI-guidance/readme.md` (updated)
- `AI-guidance/create-prd.md`
- `AI-guidance/generate-tasks.md`
- `AI-guidance/process-task-list.md`

### Tasks
- `tasks/README.md`
- `tasks/0001-prd-feature-pack-0001-setup.md` (updated)
- `tasks/0002-prd-feature-pack-0002-plan.md`
- `tasks/tasks-0001-prd-feature-pack-0001-setup.md`

### Other
- `branches.md` (already present in `javascript-experiments`)

## Next Steps

When this PR is merged to `javascript-experiments`, all the work from the original PR #7 will be in the correct branch, and the `main` branch will remain clean (with the revert in place).

## Note

The local `javascript-experiments` branch has been updated with these changes but has NOT been pushed to remote (since we don't have direct push permissions). Instead, this PR serves as the mechanism to get the changes into `javascript-experiments` when merged.
