- `docs/strategy-kotlin-js.md` - Comprehensive analysis of Kotlin/JS transpilation strategy
- `docs/strategy-typescript-rewrite.md` - Comprehensive analysis of clean TypeScript rewrite strategy
- `docs/strategy-comparison-matrix.md` - Side-by-side comparison of all strategies across evaluation criteria
- `docs/poc-roadmap.md` - Proof-of-concept plans for each strategy
- `docs/research-notes/` - Directory for research findings, references, and supporting documentation
  - `java-to-wasm-compilers.md` - Analysis of WASM compiler options (GraalVM, TeaVM, JWebAssembly, CheerpJ)
  - `kotlin-js-capabilities.md` - Kotlin/JS compiler capabilities and limitations research
  - `typescript-ecosystem.md` - TypeScript ecosystem and openEHR JavaScript libraries
  - `similar-conversion-projects.md` - Case studies of comparable conversion projects

### Notes

- All strategy documents should be comprehensive, concise, and to the point
- Include architecture diagrams where helpful
- Research should cite sources and reference similar projects
- Analysis should be objective and avoid bias toward any particular strategy
- Documents are for stakeholder decision-making, so clarity is critical
