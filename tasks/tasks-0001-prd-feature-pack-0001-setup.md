# Task List for Feature Pack 0001 - Setup

Generated from: `0001-prd-feature-pack-0001-setup.md`

## Relevant Files

- `docs/setup-verification-report.md` - Comprehensive setup summary report documenting all verification results (to be created)
- `docs/branch-verification.md` - Documentation of branch alignment verification with upstream adl_2.4_support (created)
- `docs/test-results.md` - Test execution results including pass/fail counts and error details (to be created)
- `docs/deepwiki-access.md` - Deepwiki MCP access verification and sample query results (to be created)
- `docs/documentation-inventory.md` - Inventory of available documentation resources (to be created)
- `.gitignore` - May need updates to exclude any temporary verification files
- `README.md` - Existing project documentation (review, no modifications)
- `build.gradle` - Gradle build configuration (review, no modifications)
- `gradlew` / `gradlew.bat` - Gradle wrapper scripts (verify functionality)

### Notes

- All documentation files should be created in a `docs/` directory to keep verification artifacts organized
- Use Markdown format for all documentation files for consistency
- The `./gradlew test` command will be used to execute Java tests
- Git commands will be used for branch verification operations
- No code modifications should be made during this verification phase

## Tasks

- [x] 1.0 Verify Branch Alignment with Upstream adl_2.4_support
  - [x] 1.1 Add upstream remote for openEHR/archie repository if not already present
  - [x] 1.2 Fetch latest commits from upstream adl_2.4_support branch
  - [x] 1.3 Compare current branch commit history with upstream adl_2.4_support
  - [x] 1.4 Identify any missing commits or divergence from upstream
  - [x] 1.5 Document findings in `docs/branch-verification.md` including commit comparison results
  - [x] 1.6 If divergence exists, rebase or merge upstream changes into javascript-experiments branch
  - [x] 1.7 Verify branch is up-to-date after rebase/merge operation
  - [x] 1.8 Update branch-verification.md with final status and any actions taken

- [ ] 2.0 Verify Deepwiki MCP Access and Documentation Resources
  - [ ] 2.1 Attempt to connect to deepwiki MCP server
  - [ ] 2.3 Verify access to https://deepwiki.com/openEHR/archie resource
  - [ ] 2.4 Verify access to https://deepwiki.com/openEHR/specifications-ITS-BMM resource
  - [ ] 2.2 Test the `ask_question` tool with sample queries about both openEHR archie and specifications-ITS-BMM resources
  - [ ] 2.5 Document successful connection and sample query results in `docs/deepwiki-access.md`
  - [ ] 2.6 If deepwiki MCP is not accessible, document alternative documentation sources and fallback plan
  - [ ] 2.7 Create documentation inventory listing all available resources in `docs/documentation-inventory.md`
  - [ ] 2.8 Note how future agents should use deepwiki MCP for documentation lookup

- [ ] 3.0 Execute and Document Java Test Suite
  - [ ] 3.1 Verify Java JDK is installed and meets version requirements (JDK 8 or higher for runtime, JDK 11+ for build)
  - [ ] 3.2 Verify Gradle wrapper (gradlew) is present and executable
  - [ ] 3.3 Run `./gradlew build` to ensure project builds successfully
  - [ ] 3.4 Execute full test suite using `./gradlew test` and capture results (total tests, passing, failing, execution time, and any test failures with brief descriptions in `docs/test-results.md`)
  - [ ] 3.10 Determine if failures are pre-existing or related to setup
  - [ ] 3.11 Document test environment details (Java version, Gradle version, OS)

- [ ] 4.0 Check for JavaScript/TypeScript Tests
  - [ ] 4.1 Search repository for JavaScript/TypeScript test files (*.test.js, *.spec.js, *.test.ts, *.spec.ts)
  - [ ] 4.2 Search for test configuration files (jest.config.js, package.json with test scripts, etc.)
  - [ ] 4.3 If tests exist, identify the test framework being used (Jest, Mocha, etc.)
  - [ ] 4.4 If tests exist, verify Node.js/npm/yarn is installed
  - [ ] 4.5 If tests exist, run npm/yarn install to install dependencies
  - [ ] 4.6 If tests exist, execute JavaScript/TypeScript tests using appropriate command
  - [ ] 4.7 If tests exist, document test results in `docs/test-results.md`
  - [ ] 4.8 If no tests exist, document absence of JavaScript/TypeScript tests in `docs/test-results.md`

- [ ] 5.0 Generate Setup Summary Report
  - [ ] 5.1 Create `docs/setup-verification-report.md` file
  - [ ] 5.2 Compile branch verification status from branch-verification.md
  - [ ] 5.3 Compile test execution results from test-results.md
  - [ ] 5.4 Compile documentation access status from deepwiki-access.md and documentation-inventory.md
  - [ ] 5.5 List any issues or blockers identified during verification
  - [ ] 5.6 Assess severity of any identified issues (critical, major, minor)
  - [ ] 5.7 Provide recommendations for proceeding to Feature Pack 0002
  - [ ] 5.8 Document confirmation that no critical blockers exist (or identify any that do)
  - [ ] 5.9 Include summary of all success metrics from PRD
  - [ ] 5.10 Review and finalize setup summary report for completeness

### Notes

- This is a verification and documentation feature pack
- No code implementation or refactoring should be performed
- Existing failing tests should be documented but not fixed
- All results will be documented for decision-making before Feature Pack 0002
- All documentation artifacts should be committed to version control for reference
