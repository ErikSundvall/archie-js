# Product Requirements Document: Feature Pack 0002 - Conversion Strategy Planning

## Introduction/Overview

Feature Pack 0002 focuses on detailed analysis and documentation of alternative strategies for converting the Archie openEHR library from Java to JavaScript/TypeScript for browser-based execution. This planning phase establishes the foundation for informed decision-making about the conversion approach before any implementation begins.

The primary problem this feature pack solves is determining the optimal technical strategy for making Archie's capabilities available in web browsers without external server dependencies (beyond initial static file loading). The current Archie implementation is Java-based, which cannot run natively in browsers. This feature pack will evaluate multiple conversion approaches to identify the best path forward.

Key challenges to address:
1. Java code cannot execute in browsers without intermediary technology
2. Need to maintain code quality and test coverage during conversion
3. Must support modular usage (use case #1 shouldn't require loading all features)
4. Performance and bundle size constraints for browser environments
5. Long-term maintenance considerations for the converted codebase

## Goals

1. **Comprehensive Strategy Analysis**: Document at least three distinct conversion strategies with detailed technical evaluation (5+ pages each)

2. **Evidence-Based Comparison**: Evaluate each strategy against comprehensive criteria including:
   - Technical feasibility and architecture
   - Long-term maintenance implications
   - Runtime performance characteristics
   - Development timeline and resource requirements
   - Team skill requirements
   - Browser compatibility considerations
   - Bundle size and loading performance
   - Cost implications

3. **Informed Decision Support**: Provide sufficient analysis depth to enable stakeholder decision-making without implementation bias

4. **POC Roadmap**: For each strategy, outline what a proof-of-concept would entail (to be implemented in later feature packs)

5. **Modular Architecture Planning**: Define how each strategy supports modular loading for progressive feature adoption

6. **Risk Assessment**: Identify and document technical risks, limitations, and trade-offs for each approach

## User Stories

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **No Implementation**: This feature pack does NOT include actual code conversion or proof-of-concept implementation

2. **No Final Decision**: This feature pack provides analysis but does not make the final strategy selection (stakeholder decision)

3. **No POC Code**: Proof-of-concept development is deferred to Feature Pack 0003 or later

4. **No Performance Benchmarks**: Actual performance testing requires implementation (estimates only)

5. **No Tool Selection Within Strategies**: Deep dive into specific tools (e.g., which WASM compiler) is deferred to implementation phase

6. **No Migration Planning**: Detailed migration steps and data conversion are out of scope

7. **No Production Deployment Planning**: Deployment strategy, CI/CD, and production concerns are future work

8. **No Security Analysis**: Detailed security assessment beyond basic considerations is out of scope

9. **No Complete Archie Feature Analysis**: Focus is on architecture and approach, not exhaustive feature mapping

## Design Considerations

N/A - This is a planning and documentation feature pack with no user-facing design components. However, strategy documents should include architectural diagrams where helpful.

## Technical Considerations

### 1. Existing Archie Architecture

**Java Module Structure** (from Feature Pack 0001 verification):
- `aom` - Archetype Object Model
- `base` - Base infrastructure
- `bmm` - Basic Meta-Model
- `grammars` - ADL parsers
- `i18n` - Internationalization
- `odin` - ODIN parser
